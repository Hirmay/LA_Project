# Modelling and Simulation Of 3D objects

In this project, we’ll try to Model Objects and animation by using applications of linear
algebra such as Translation, Transformation Matrices, and Multiple Transformation
Execution. Translation means the movement of an object (which in our case would be 3D)
from one position to another position. The matrices here are square (4x4) which not only
does translations and perspective but scales and rotations. We will represent 3-dimensional
points using homogenous coordinates. We’ll also take the help of some python libraries
PyOpenGL and PyGame. By the end of the project, we want to achieve a program that will
help in modeling and simulation of those models generated using a homogenous coordinate
system. The applications could be many such as simulations of molecules, visual learning,
architecture, etc.
